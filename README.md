# text_adventure_game
First assignement with a concept full developed on my own

Functions used in the script: user defined functions, list, if sentences and random choices

Concept: using chracters of History Channel - Vikings the game consists in delives a message to one of the chiefs: 
'Ragnar', 'Lagertha', 'Floki', 'Rollo', 'Bjorn Ironside', 'Ivar - The Bonless'. The user must answer some questions as the assigned chief could do.

Process:
1. Define functions an create list of features.
2. Create the sets of features for each Viking from the previous list.
3. Randomly select one of the Viking's characters.
4. Define functions to start and "travel".
5. Create the questions that will be randomly chosen to play.
6. Create the functions to win and fail in the questions.
7. Run the game
